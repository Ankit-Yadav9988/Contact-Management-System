# Contact Management System

A simple and responsive web application for managing contacts. This system allows users to add, edit, delete, and search contacts. It uses `localStorage` to persist contact data and provides a light/dark mode toggle.

## Features

- **Add Contact**: Users can add new contacts with their name, email, phone number, and address.
- **Display Contacts**: View all saved contacts with the option to edit or delete them.
- **Search Contacts**: Search for contacts by name.
- **Edit Contact**: Update contact information such as name, email, phone number, and address.
- **Delete Contact**: Remove contacts from the list.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark mode for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ankit-yadav9988/Contact-Management-System.git
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to use the Contact Management System.
How It Works
**Add Contact:** The "Add Contact" form allows users to input the contact's details. When submitted, the contact is saved to localStorage and displayed in the contact list.

**Display Contacts:** The "Display Contacts" section shows all saved contacts. Each contact has the options to edit or delete.

**Search Contacts:** The search bar allows users to filter the contact list by name.

**Light/Dark Mode:** Users can toggle between light and dark mode for a personalized experience. This preference is saved in localStorage.

# Features to Implement
1. Form Validation: Add additional form validation, such as checking for a valid phone number format.
2. Persistent Dark Mode: Save the dark mode preference across sessions.
3. Mobile Responsiveness: Further optimize the design for mobile devices.
