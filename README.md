- **Display Contacts**: View all saved contacts with the option to edit or delete them.
- **Search Contacts**: Search for contacts by name.
- **Edit Contact**: Update contact information such as name, email, phone number, and address.
- **Delete Contact**: Remove contacts from the list.

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to use the Contact Management System.
How It Works
Add Contact: The "Add Contact" form allows users to input the contact's details. When submitted, the contact is saved to localStorage and displayed in the contact list.

Display Contacts: The "Display Contacts" section shows all saved contacts. Each contact has the options to edit or delete.

Search Contacts: The search bar allows users to filter the contact list by name.

Light/Dark Mode: Users can toggle between light and dark mode for a personalized experience. This preference is saved in localStorage.

Features to Implement
Form Validation: Add additional form validation, such as checking for a valid phone number format.
Persistent Dark Mode: Save the dark mode preference across sessions.
Mobile Responsiveness: Further optimize the design for mobile devices.
